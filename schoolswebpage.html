                    <p>
                        Rato Bangala is a co-educational day school in Lalitpur, Nepal, founded in 1992, known for its progressive,
                        child-centered learning and teacher training programs. It emphasizes developing critical thinking, social
                        responsibility, and holistic development through its curriculum and is also home to a non-profit foundation that extends
                        its educational practices to the wider community, particularly through teacher training.

                        Educational Philosophy: Rato Bangala was the first school in Nepal to introduce a child-centered curriculum, inspired by
                        its affiliation with the Bank Street College of Education in New York. It prioritizes experiential and interdisciplinary
                        learning to make education meaningful and relevant.
